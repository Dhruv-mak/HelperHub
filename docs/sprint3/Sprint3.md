   - `validates form fields and shows error message on invalid input`: Tests form validation by entering invalid inputs and checking for error messages.  
   - `validates max length for organization name`: Ensures the organization name does not exceed 100 characters and displays an error if it does.  
   - `submits form and calls registerOrganization on valid input`: Mocks a successful form submission and verifies that `registerOrganization` is called with the correct parameters, and the user is redirected to the dashboard.  

2. **VolunteerRegistration.test.tsx**  
   - `renders the form with fields and submit button`: Verifies that all input fields and the submit button are displayed.  
   - `validates form fields and shows error message on invalid input`: Ensures form validation works by checking for error messages when invalid data is entered.

9 - 13 Akash Balaji

### Backend

       
1. API endpoint that retrieves available volunteer opportunities for the Opportunities page. This endpoint will be used by volunteers to browse and search for opportunities they can apply to.
2.  API endpoint that retrieves all volunteer opportunities associated with a specific organization. This endpoint is already being called from the frontend Projects page but needs implementation on the backend.
3. The system should provide an API endpoint to fetch the last N opportunities created by an organization where the end_date has already passed (i.e., end_date < current_date). This will help organizations track past opportunities easily.
4. The system should provide an API endpoint to fetch the last N opportunities for which a volunteer's application was accepted and the end_date has already passed (i.e., end_date < current_date). This will help volunteers track their past accepted opportunities.
5. The system should provide an API endpoint to fetch the total number of jobs a volunteer has participated in and the total hours worked across all accepted opportunities. This will help track a volunteerâ€™s contribution over time.
6. Refactor : Current model of opportunity field does not have start_date and end_date field. Add those fields and update opportunity end points.
7. We need to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for managing organizations in the system. This will allow users to create new organizations, retrieve organization details, update information, and delete organizations when necessary.
8. Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the Application model. This model represents applications submitted by volunteers for various opportunities. It allows volunteers to apply, update their applications, and check their statuses while ensuring organizations can review and manage applications.

9. Implemented Unit tests for -
```
Organization
Volunteer
Application
Category
Opportunity 
```     
Task completed by Pratham: 1-8.
Testing is completed by Nikhil. 
        

## Backlogs that were cleared from sprint 2
### Frontend
1. **E2E Testing**
     - Implemented E2E testing for registration, sign in, sign out
1. **User Dashboard**
     - 

2. **Authentication Integration**
     - Integration of Auth0 for authentication

### Backend
1. **Scheduling APIs**
     - Development of APIs for scheduling functionalities
     - Specialized APIs are pending implementation, including:
     - Fetching all recent jobs completed by a volunteer using `volunteer_id`.
     - Retrieving the total number of jobs and hours worked for a volunteer.
     - Displaying recent opportunities published by organizations.

## Issues Not Completed in Sprint 3

### Reason for Incompletion
The pending tasks from Sprint 3 were not completed due to **time constraints and prioritization of core features**. Initial efforts were focused on setting up fundamental functionalities, authentication flows, and ensuring backend stability. As a result, certain advanced features and integrations had to be deferred to the next sprint.

### Frontend
- End-to-End (E2E) testing is not yet implemented.
- Some parts of Opportunity and Application is still using mock not actual fetched data from backend.
- Dashboard for managing opportunities and applications is not yet built. It lacks the graph for the recent jobs.

### Backend
- Testing for a few special API's are still left
- Some changes in Opportunity model lead to some changes in the testing which are not completed in this sprint.

### Next Steps
The pending features will be prioritized in **Sprint 4**, ensuring:
- Complete E2E testing for all pages

- Full API support for volunteer and organization dashboards.
- Full integration and full coverage for testing in frontend.
- E2E tests for ensuring app stability before deployment.
- Containerization of the application for easy deployment.
