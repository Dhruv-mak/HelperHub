## Backend Development
### Opportunity Management API Endpoints  

### 1. **Last N opportunities for Organization where End Date < Current Date**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /opportunities/organization/:organization_mail/expired`  
**Description**: Retrieve the last 'n' opportunities where the end_date is less than the current date for a specific organization.  

### 2. **Get all Opportunities with Application Counts**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /opportunities`  
**Description**: Retrieve all opportunities for a specific organization, including the number of applications each opportunity has received.

### Application Management API Endpoints

### 1. **Get Applications by Volunteer with Details**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /applications/volunteer/:volunteer_id`  
**Description**: Retrieves all applications submitted by a specific volunteer, including opportunity titles and organization names through table joins. This provides volunteers with a comprehensive view of their application history.

### 2. **Get Applications by Opportunity with Volunteer Details**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /applications/opportunity/:opportunity_id`  
**Description**: Retrieves all applications for a specific opportunity with detailed volunteer information. Organizations can use this to review applicants efficiently.


### Unit Tests  

### Endpoint: GET /applications/volunteer/{volunteer_id}
### Description: Retrieves all applications submitted by a specific volunteer, enriched with opportunity title and organization name.
Test Cases Implemented:

Successful retrieval of applications with complete details
Handling of invalid/non-existent volunteer IDs
Testing with multiple applications from a single volunteer
Database error handling
Data validation to ensure all required fields are present

The tests verify that the endpoint correctly joins data across the applications, opportunities, and organizations tables to provide a comprehensive view of a volunteer's engagement history.

### Endpoint: GET /opportunities/{opportunity_id}/applications
### Description: Fetches all applications for a specific opportunity with detailed volunteer information.
Test Cases Implemented:

Successful retrieval of applications with volunteer details
Empty/invalid opportunity ID handling
Testing with multiple volunteers applying to the same opportunity
Verification of correct sorting (most recent first)
Database error handling
Response field validation

These tests ensure the endpoint properly connects volunteer information with applications and correctly orders the results by creation time.


### Endpoint: GET /opportunities/{id}
### Description: Retrieves comprehensive details of a specific opportunity, including statistics about applications by status.
Test Cases Implemented:

Successful retrieval of opportunity details with accurate application counts
Testing with opportunities having no applications
Non-existent opportunity ID handling
Case sensitivity in application status counting
Complete field validation

These tests verify that the endpoint correctly calculates application statistics (total, pending, accepted, rejected) while returning all necessary opportunity details.

### Implementation Approach
All tests follow best practices for Go unit testing:

- Clean database setup and teardown
- Dynamic test data creation to avoid constraint violations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Explicit assertions for expected outcomes
- Testing of both success and failure scenarios

9 - 13 Akash Balaji

### Backend

       
1. API endpoint that retrieves available volunteer opportunities for the Opportunities page. This endpoint will be used by volunteers to browse and search for opportunities they can apply to.
2.  API endpoint that retrieves all volunteer opportunities associated with a specific organization. This endpoint is already being called from the frontend Projects page but needs implementation on the backend.
3. The system should provide an API endpoint to fetch the last N opportunities created by an organization where the end_date has already passed (i.e., end_date < current_date). This will help organizations track past opportunities easily.
4. The system should provide an API endpoint to fetch the last N opportunities for which a volunteer's application was accepted and the end_date has already passed (i.e., end_date < current_date). This will help volunteers track their past accepted opportunities.
5. The system should provide an API endpoint to fetch the total number of jobs a volunteer has participated in and the total hours worked across all accepted opportunities. This will help track a volunteerâ€™s contribution over time.
6. Refactor : Current model of opportunity field does not have start_date and end_date field. Add those fields and update opportunity end points.
7. We need to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for managing organizations in the system. This will allow users to create new organizations, retrieve organization details, update information, and delete organizations when necessary.
8. Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for the Application model. This model represents applications submitted by volunteers for various opportunities. It allows volunteers to apply, update their applications, and check their statuses while ensuring organizations can review and manage applications.

9. Implemented Unit tests for -
```
Organization
Volunteer
Application
Category
Opportunity 
```     
Task completed by Pratham: 1-8.
Testing is completed by Nikhil. 
        

## Backlogs that were cleared from sprint 3
### Frontend
1. **Comprehensive testing**
     - Implemented more comprehensive testing for all componenets that could not be done in previous sprints.
2. **User Dashboard**
     - Completion of dashboard for opportunity and application.

<!-- 2. **Authentication Integration**
     - Integration of Auth0 for authentication -->

### Backend
1. **Scheduling APIs**
     - Development of APIs for scheduling functionalities
     - Specialized APIs are pending implementation, including:
     - Fetching all recent jobs completed by a volunteer using `volunteer_id`.
     - Retrieving the total number of jobs and hours worked for a volunteer.
     - Displaying recent opportunities published by organizations.

<!-- ## Issues Not Completed in Sprint 3

### Reason for Incompletion
The pending tasks from Sprint 3 were not completed due to **time constraints and prioritization of core features**. Initial efforts were focused on setting up fundamental functionalities, authentication flows, and ensuring backend stability. As a result, certain advanced features and integrations had to be deferred to the next sprint.

### Frontend
- End-to-End (E2E) testing is not yet implemented.
- Some parts of Opportunity and Application is still using mock not actual fetched data from backend.
- Dashboard for managing opportunities and applications is not yet built. It lacks the graph for the recent jobs.

### Backend
- Testing for a few special API's are still left
- Some changes in Opportunity model lead to some changes in the testing which are not completed in this sprint.

### Next Steps
The pending features will be prioritized in **Sprint 4**, ensuring:
- Complete E2E testing for all pages

- Full API support for volunteer and organization dashboards.
- Full integration and full coverage for testing in frontend.
- E2E tests for ensuring app stability before deployment.
- Containerization of the application for easy deployment. -->
