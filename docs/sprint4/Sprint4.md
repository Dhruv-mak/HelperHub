### 2. **Get all Opportunities with Application Counts**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /opportunities`  
**Description**: Retrieve all opportunities for a specific organization, including the number of applications each opportunity has received.

### Application Management API Endpoints

### 1. **Get Applications by Volunteer with Details**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /applications/volunteer/:volunteer_id`  
**Description**: Retrieves all applications submitted by a specific volunteer, including opportunity titles and organization names through table joins. This provides volunteers with a comprehensive view of their application history.

### 2. **Get Applications by Opportunity with Volunteer Details**  
**Endpoint**: `GET /applications/opportunity/:opportunity_id`  
**Description**: Retrieves all applications for a specific opportunity with detailed volunteer information. Organizations can use this to review applicants efficiently.


### Unit Tests  

### Endpoint: GET /applications/volunteer/{volunteer_id}

Test Cases Implemented:

Successful retrieval of applications with complete details
Handling of invalid/non-existent volunteer IDs
Testing with multiple applications from a single volunteer
Database error handling
Data validation to ensure all required fields are present

The tests verify that the endpoint correctly joins data across the applications, opportunities, and organizations tables to provide a comprehensive view of a volunteer's engagement history.

### Endpoint: GET /opportunities/{opportunity_id}/applications
### Description: Fetches all applications for a specific opportunity with detailed volunteer information.
Test Cases Implemented:

Successful retrieval of applications with volunteer details
Empty/invalid opportunity ID handling
Testing with multiple volunteers applying to the same opportunity
Verification of correct sorting (most recent first)
Database error handling
Response field validation

These tests ensure the endpoint properly connects volunteer information with applications and correctly orders the results by creation time.


### Endpoint: GET /opportunities/{id}

Test Cases Implemented:

Successful retrieval of opportunity details with accurate application counts
Testing with opportunities having no applications
Non-existent opportunity ID handling
Case sensitivity in application status counting
Complete field validation

These tests verify that the endpoint correctly calculates application statistics (total, pending, accepted, rejected) while returning all necessary opportunity details.

### Implementation Approach
All tests follow best practices for Go unit testing:

- Clean database setup and teardown
- Dynamic test data creation to avoid constraint violations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Explicit assertions for expected outcomes
- Testing of both success and failure scenarios

<!-- ## Issues Not Completed in Sprint 3

### Reason for Incompletion
The pending tasks from Sprint 3 were not completed due to **time constraints and prioritization of core features**. Initial efforts were focused on setting up fundamental functionalities, authentication flows, and ensuring backend stability. As a result, certain advanced features and integrations had to be deferred to the next sprint.

### Frontend
- End-to-End (E2E) testing is not yet implemented.
- Some parts of Opportunity and Application is still using mock not actual fetched data from backend.
- Dashboard for managing opportunities and applications is not yet built. It lacks the graph for the recent jobs.

### Backend
- Testing for a few special API's are still left
- Some changes in Opportunity model lead to some changes in the testing which are not completed in this sprint.

### Next Steps
The pending features will be prioritized in **Sprint 4**, ensuring:
- Complete E2E testing for all pages

- Full API support for volunteer and organization dashboards.
- Full integration and full coverage for testing in frontend.
- E2E tests for ensuring app stability before deployment.
- Containerization of the application for easy deployment. -->
