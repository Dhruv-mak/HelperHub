## Issues Not Completed in Sprint 2

### Reason for Incompletion
The pending tasks from Sprint 2 were not completed due to **time constraints and prioritization of core features**. Initial efforts were focused on setting up fundamental functionalities, authentication flows, and ensuring backend stability. As a result, certain advanced features and integrations had to be deferred to the next sprint.

### Frontend
- End-to-End (E2E) testing is not yet implemented.
- Forms for creating an opportunity are incomplete.
- Functionality to apply to an opportunity is missing.
- Dashboard for managing opportunities and applications is not yet built.

### Backend
- Specialized APIs are pending implementation, including:
  - Fetching all recent jobs completed by a volunteer using `volunteer_id`.
  - Retrieving the total number of jobs and hours worked for a volunteer.
  - Displaying recent opportunities published by organizations.

### Next Steps
The pending features will be prioritized in **Sprint 3**, ensuring:
- Full API support for volunteer and organization dashboards.
- Completion of opportunity-related forms and workflows.
- E2E tests for ensuring app stability before deployment.
